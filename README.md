### What I learned

- How to use grid. 
- Used grid and flexbox to get to the desired solution along with media queries. 
- Tried to use Boostrap
- Display: flow-root, used it on blockquote. 
- Float property for blockquote, but i used absolute positioning to get the desired result. 
- Practiced clamp(), calc() and min() properties.
